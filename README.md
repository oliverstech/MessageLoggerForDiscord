# Message Logger For Discord
A guide to Discord Message Logger by Oliver's Tech Corner!

**WARNING**: This utilises a self-bot library to view messages recieved, so you are using this at your own risk. However, the chance of being banned is very low!

**WARNING**: Using the 'Log ALL messages' function can cause your console to become very congested if you are in a lot of servers! Please take caution using this feature.

This bot needs your token to run. But being open source, it's not going to steal your token! You can read the code yourself if you don't trust me!


Getting your token
-----------------------
1. Open a chromium-based browser (edge, chrome, brave etc).
2. Press F12 and click 'Network'.
3. Type 'library' in the search bar.
4. Refresh the page; an entry with 'library...' should appear. It may have more information at the end, like 'library?country_code=GB' etc.
5. Click on it! Then, scroll until you see 'authorization'. Right click and press 'Copy value'. 

Congrats! You've just copied your discord auth token. 

**Be careful with this: sharing this token can give attackers access to your Discord account...**

Usage
---------------
Simply run the EXE, choose your mode, paste your token and hit begin!


Using channel ID mode
-----------------------------------------------
When you choose to use channel ID mode, you'll be asked to paste a channel ID (makes sense). This is the end of the URL on the web-based version of Discord.

https://discord.com/channels/@me/1234567890

https://discord.com/channels/1234567890/0987654321

The first URL channel ID would be '1234567890'.

In the case of the second URL, you would only copy the second number and not the first one, since the first one is the Guild ID (server ID), not the channel. So, in this case, the ID would be '0987654321'.
